# wikiLocation
A simple test app with a list of locations. 
Tapping on a location should call the Wikipedia app to demonstrate the functionality.


The client app doesn't have validation of a custom location entered by the user. 

The latitude must be a number between -90 and 90 and the longitude between -180 and 180.
