First of all, I am using not a main branch of the Wikipedia iOS Project.
The reason:
1. The Wikipedia iOS Project's main branch already migrated to Xcode 12 beta.
2. One of the repository ('hpple') which is present in the cartage config file was deleted, and those changes were not included in the main branch yet.

My repo configured to build in Xcode 11 and based on a branch with excluded 'hpple' dependency.


The client app doesn't have validation of entered user data of a custom location.
The latitude must be a number between -90 and 90 and the longitude between -180 and 180.
